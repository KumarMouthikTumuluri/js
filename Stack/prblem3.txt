An example of a real-world stack is a Pez dispenser. Imagine that your virtual Pez
dispenser is filled with red, yellow, and white colors and you donâ€™t like the yellow
ones. Write a program that uses a stack (and maybe more than one) to remove the
yellow ones without changing the order of the other candies in the dispenser.



import { Stack } from "./stack.module.js";

function removecolour(arr,colour){
    
    var s = new Stack();
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) {
      
         if(arr[i]!==colour){
          s.push(arr[i]);
         } 
         
    }
    arr =[];
    for (let j=s.length(); j > 0;j--) {
    arr[j-1]=s.pop();
    }
    return arr;

}
        let arr=["white","yellow","red","white","yellow","red","white","yellow","red"];
        let colour="yellow"
    
        let a=removecolour(arr,colour);

        console.log(a);
